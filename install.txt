Installation:

1. Initialising the Server:

	The application has been designed to operate on a Linux based server, during production we used 
	a ubuntu 14.04 which is a recommended server because of the cost factor (being none) and
	the large repositories available.


2. Connecting to the server:

	Once a server linux based operating system has been implemented, you need to SSH into it.
	This is achieved by the following commands:

		sudo apt-get install openssh-server
		sudo apt-get update
	
	This should be done on both server/client machine to ensure communication can be established.

3. Setting up LAMP on the server:

	Once both have fully updated you will want to install LAMP (linux,Apache,MySQL,PHP) on the server
	by calling the following in the terminal:

		sudo apt-get install apache2
		sudo apt-get update

	These set up Apache which will act as the web server. Next stage in the LAMP installation is 		installing MySQL. To do this run the following command
	on the server side:

		sudo apt-get install mysql-server php5-mysql
			
			-NOTE: during the installation of mysql, you will be prompted to 
			initialise a root password. Ensure you make it something remember-able/secure

	Once the above command/prompts have finished enter the following:

		sudo mysql_install_db

	The final step is to install PHP onto the server, to do so run the following command in terminal:

		sudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mcrypt

4. Setting up MySQL database:
	
	Before we start setting up the database, I'd like to recommend the following application:

		http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/
	
	MySQL workbench is a free and extremely useful tool in interacting with databases. I recommend
	you download the application through the link provided and follow their installation guide.

	Once MySQL Workbench is install, move to the SQL folder in the project folder.

		../APHB-3200/SQL

	This folder as the name gives away holds all the scripts to build the applications database.
	It is advised you load up/execute seminar_marks.sql first as that contains all the scripts to
	build the basic skeleton on the database.

	Once seminar_marks.sql has been completely loaded into the database feel free to repeat this 
	process for the remaining files in the folder. The remaining folders will produce the views which
	take advantage of MySQL optimised search queries. 

	The final stage is to navigate to ../APHB-3200/Library/DB/config.php
	This file contains the settings for your servers MySQL. Please enter the appropriate 
	values for user name,password and enter "seminar_marks" as the desired schema. 


5. Setting up your login account:

	Currently the login account is quite insecure with the password being quite obvious. The 		password value has been hashed using md5 and a salt (included in the 
	/APHB-3200/Library/Helper/config.php file). Currently the user account is as follows:

		Username: Admin
		Password: Password

	It is assumed you will be wanting to alter this to provide a more secure application. As there
	will only ever be one user using this application, user initiation has been excluded from the 
	application as the event would be rare. 

	The following are the SQL commands you will want to execute into the database:

	DELETE FROM seminar_marks.users;		// this will empty the user table
	INSERT INTO seminar_marks.users values (1, ?, ? , null,null,null);

	The two question marks corrospond to username and password. When replacing the ? with your
	new strings, ensure they are wrapped in " " to ensure no errors occur.
	
	In creating your password, you must go to the following URL

		https://www.functions-online.com/crypt.html
	
	enter in your new password in the $str input bar and place the value stored at 
	/APHB-3200/Library/Helper/config.php file into the $Salt input bar.
	This will produce a string underneath result: which you should place into the second ? in the 
	above insertion query. 

	If you have changed the salt to something else then repeat the process and add your own salt to 
	the input bar ensuring that the first three characters are $1$ and ending in $ (to ensure md5).
	

6. Placing the folder into the correct directory:
	
	Once all other steps have been completed, its time to place it into its final directory at which 		point the application will be live. Place the APHB-3200 folder into:

	../var/www/html/ 		(this is for a Linux distributions)

	
7. File ownership must be set for ../APHB-3200/Temp owner must be www-data
	
	#chown -R www-data:www-data ../APHB-3200/Temp
