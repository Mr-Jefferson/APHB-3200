Subject: 	Import
Description:

The initial implementation of importing required conversion to .csv, and was not very 'nice' to use.
Because of the limitations of LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE, and the lack of control over error handling, I scraped it and started again.
Import now uses PHPExcel, and can import csv/xls/xlsx. MySQL insert queries are generated from imported files using PHP, with error checking.
Also, previously CSV_Handler was located in a bit of a 'dodgy' bad-programming place to put it
Because Arun made his error handler a class, I was able to use his class to check my data, avoiding 10+hours of coding.
